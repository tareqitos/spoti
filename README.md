## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally, you'll need to set up a `.env.local` file with your Spotify API credentials. Follow these steps:

### 1. Create a `.env.local` File
In the root directory of the project, create a file named `.env.local` and add the following environment variables:

```env
REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
```

Replace `your_spotify_client_id` with the credentials from your Spotify Developer Dashboard. You can create an app in the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) to get these credentials.
